#A1. 569 observations. 

#Q2. How many of the observations have a malignant diagnosis?

#Q4. From your results, what proportion of the original variance is captured by the first principal components (PC1)?

#A4. The proportion of variance captured by the first principal component (PC1) is 0.4427 (44.27% of the original variance).

#Q5. How many principal components (PCs) are required to describe at least 70% of the original variance in the data?

#Q5. Cumulative Proportion for PC1: 0.4427.  Cumulative Proportion for PC2: 0.6324. Cumulative Proportion for PC3: 0.72636.  At PC3, the cumulative proportion exceeds 70%. Thus, 3 principal components are required to describe at least 70% of the original variance.

#Q6. How many principal components (PCs) are required to describe at least 90% of the original variance in the data?
 
#A6. Cumulative Proportion for PC1: 0.4427.  Cumulative Proportion for PC2: 0.6324.  Cumulative Proportion for PC3: 0.72636.  Cumulative Proportion for PC4: 0.79239.  Cumulative Proportion for PC5: 0.84734.  Cumulative Proportion for PC6: 0.88759.  Cumulative Proportion for PC7: 0.91010.  At PC7, the cumulative proportion exceeds 90%. Thus, 7 principal components are required to describe at least 90% of the original variance.

#Q7. What stands out to you about this plot? Is it easy or difficult to understand? Why?

#A7. Need to generate own plots to gain usable insight of PCA results.
